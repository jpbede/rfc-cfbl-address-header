# Complaint Feedback Loop Address Header

The document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to specify a complaint feedback loop (FBL) address as a message header field. 
Also, it defines the rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. 
The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an address for a complaint feedback loop. 
Currently, providing and maintaining such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for Message Originators and Mailbox Providers.
